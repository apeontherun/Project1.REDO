# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
With the rising interest rates, the economy as we know it has become a bit unpredictable. These rising rates has caused a tremendous amount strain various marketplace. For this project we will take a deeper dive and see how federal interest rates effect technology sector and the housing market. The timeframe set for this project is January 1, 2020 through October 31, 2023. During this timeframe we are able to see these rates at their lowest and the most recent highs.  At conclusion of this project, I hope to identify a correlation between federal interest rates and aforementioned markets.  In addition, determine any stategic investment or trading opportunities

# CONCLUSION
As a result of the project there was no correlation between the technology sector and Discount Federal Fund Rate, although the Nasdaq appeared to be heavily influenced by rate changes. In contrary, the US Home Sold had a strong correlation with the Discount Federal Fund Rate, further investigation will need to be conducted.  One conclude that Discount Federal Funds Rate may serve as a leading indicator for US Home Sold. Ultimately more research should be completed.
